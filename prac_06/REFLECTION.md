# REFLECTION — prac_06

**Name:** Jobayer Al Mahmud Jisan
**Date:** 02 November, 2025  

## What I Learned
- How to design and use classes (`Car`, `ProgrammingLanguage`, `Guitar`)
- Using `__str__`, instance methods, and encapsulation (`is_vintage()` calling `get_age()`)
- Proper importing and program structure using a package folder (`prac_06`)
- Formatted output using f-strings, especially currency formatting
- Testing code manually by comparing expected vs actual results

## What Went Well
- All programs worked correctly and matched the expected sample outputs
- Understanding of object-oriented programming improved
- Completed tasks in separate files, following CP1404 standards

## Challenges & Solutions
- I got confused with import paths at first, but I fixed it by running the programs from the project root and adjusting my imports.
- I had a small syntax issue in the ProgrammingLanguage __init__ method, but I spotted the mistake after checking the code again.

## Time Estimates vs Actuals
| Task | Estimated | Actual |
|------|:--------:|:-----:|
| Car + used_cars | 15 min | 20 min |
| ProgrammingLanguage + languages | 20 min | 25 min |
| Guitar + guitar_test | 20 min | 25 min |
| guitars.py + formatting | 20 min | 30 min |
| car_simulator.py | 20 min | 20 min |

**Total Estimated:** 95 min  
**Total Actual:** 120 min  

## Improvements for Next Time
- Write and run tests earlier before finishing the full program
- Push Git commits more frequently with detailed messages
