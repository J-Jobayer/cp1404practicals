# Reflection - Practical 2

**What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?**  
60%

**What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?**  
I usually watch them in the evening at home, for about 1–2 hours, either on the same day of the lecture or the next day.  

**What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?**  
I am practising coding regularly and making sure I understand the examples instead of just memorising them.

**What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?**  
I sometimes leave things too late and then rush. I need to plan my time better and avoid distractions when studying.  

**What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?**  
I tend to just copy the solution after getting stuck instead of working it out myself first. I will try to debug and experiment more before checking the sample solutions.  

**What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?**  
I’m following the standard code structure with `main()` and functions. I follow the sample solution's structure.
